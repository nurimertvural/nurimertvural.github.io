I’m a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/), and a [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) affiliate. In Summer 2025, I was a research associate at the Flatiron Institute [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/), working with [Alberto Bietti](https://alberto.bietti.me) and [Denny Wu](https://dennywu1.github.io/index.html).

My work focuses on understanding the dynamics of gradient-based methods for high-dimensional problems, especially neural network training. I’ve also worked on stochastic optimization, online learning, bandit algorithms, and nonconvex optimization.
