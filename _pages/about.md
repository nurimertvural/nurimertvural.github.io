I’m a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/), and a [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) affiliate. In Summer 2025, I was a research associate at the Flatiron Institute [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/), working with [Alberto Bietti](https://alberto.bietti.me) and [Denny Wu](https://dennywu1.github.io/index.html).

My work focuses on understanding the dynamics of gradient-based methods for high-dimensional problems, especially neural network training. I’ve also worked on stochastic optimization, online learning, bandit algorithms, and nonconvex optimization.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
