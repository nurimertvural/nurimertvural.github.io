I’m a final-year PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/), and and affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai).  In Summer 2025, I was a research intern at the Flatiron Institute [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/), working with [Alberto Bietti](https://alberto.bietti.me) and [Denny Wu](https://dennywu1.github.io/index.html). Previously, I was a Master’s student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, supervised by [Suleyman S. Kozat](https://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). 

My current research focuses on the dynamics of gradient-based methods for high-dimensional problems, with an emphasis on neural network training. I have also worked on stochastic optimization, online learning, bandit algorithms, and nonconvex optimization. Selected papers appear below.
